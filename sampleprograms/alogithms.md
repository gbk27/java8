Bubble Sort - Linear
-----------
Worst Case  - O(n2) : not suitable for large unsorted data
Avg case - O(n2) : not suitable for large unsorted data
Best Case - O(n) : best for small or nearly sorted data

Space Required : O(n) : it is candidate algorithm when minimising space is paramount

pass 1 --> 3 7 4 4 6 5 8
pass 2 -->  3 4 4 6 5 7 8 
pass 3 --> 3 4 4 5 6 7 8

Insertion Sort - Linear
--------------
Worst Case  - O(n2) : not suitable for large unsorted data
Avg case - O(n2) : not suitable for large unsorted data
Best Case - O(n) : best for small or nearly sorted data

Space Required : O(n) : it is candidate algorithm when minimising space is paramount

* data is sorted in single pass  (to check)

Selection Sort - Linear 
--------------
Worst Case  - O(n2) : not suitable for large unsorted data
Avg case - O(n2) : not suitable for large unsorted data
Best Case - O(n2) : not appropriate for large unsorted data 

Space Required : O(n) : it is candidate algorithm when minimising space is paramount


Merge Sort - Divide and Conquer
-----------
array is recursively split in half

Worst Case  - O(n log n) : appropriate for large data
Avg case - O(n log n) : appropriate for large data
Best Case - O(n log n) : appropriate for large data 

Space Required : O(n) : extra allocation increase the memory footprint required to sort data

Quick Sort - Divide and conquer
-----------
pick a pivot and partition the array

Worst Case  - O(n2) : not appropriate for large data
Avg case - O(n log n) : appropriate for large data
Best Case - O(n log n) : appropriate for large data 

Space Required : O(n) : recursive algorithm the array space as well as the stack space must be considered.
